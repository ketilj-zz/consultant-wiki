## Forsikring

​**Yrkesskadeforsikring**​ - Required by law. If I am injured due to work, etc.

​**Profesjonsansvarsforsikring**​ - Required by some brokers (such as eWork). It is liability for my consulting.

**Datakriminalitetforsikring** - This covers if I am hacked, get a virus, and lose some data or something of that nature.

**​Bedriftsansvarforsikring/Ansvarforsikring** - This is liability insurance protecting against damage my company causes but not due to my work. This would cover if I spill water all over a computer. It mainly relates to physical damage or damage against a person (if I punch a client in the nose?).

​**Produktansvarforsikring** - This is if I work on a clients product, and the product causes damage. Software products are products. Once my consulting/advice becomes a product, I need this insurance.
